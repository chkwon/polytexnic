This is an equation environment:
\[
\int_\Omega d\omega = \int_{\partial\Omega} \omega \qquad\mbox{Stokes's Theorem}
\]
This should be a centered equation with no numbering.

We also want to support equation environments:
longuniquesha
We'll probably have to handle numbering and cross-references in a post-processing step.
