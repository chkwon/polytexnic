# Code of Conduct

The maintainers of this project are committed to creating a respectful and welcoming environment for all contributors and participants. To this end, we have adopted this Code of Conduct.

When interacting as members of our community, we ask that all participants remain polite and civil, refraining from personal insults, derogatory language, or other bad behavior. Feedback on proposed contributions and related interactions should always be constructive, and should not be taken personally. Those who violate these requirements may, at the discretion of the maintainers, be temporarily or permanently prohibited from further participation. In addition, the maintainers themselves are bound by the same Code of Conduct.

Source code, documentation, and other contributions are accepted based solely on their suitability for our project, but we recognize the importance of fostering a positive social environment as well. In particular, we reserve the right to take into account individual circumstances, should contributors choose to disclose them. For example, less experienced programmers are encouraged to participate, so we may take extra steps to make sure they feel welcome.

Potential violations of this Code of Conduct should be reported privately to help@softcover.io and will be kept strictly confidential. We take all reports seriously, and will apply our best judgment to resolve any conflicts as quickly and as fairly as possible.

Based on [Code of Conduct v1.0.0](http://static.codeofconduct.io/v/1/0/0/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
